"""Your capstone agent: the one your README demos and your CI grades.

It starts as the final assignment's starter, unchanged: the same `YourAgent`,
the same `answer_question` pipeline from the course package, the same budget.
Calling it returns a `bootcamp_agent.schema.ResearchAnswer`, the contract the
whole course used, so everything you built in the sessions plugs in here.
`run(question)` returns the whole `AgentResult`, trace included, which is what
`uv run bootcamp capstone trace "<question>"` prints.

As shipped it is honest and insufficient. On the offline `FakeLLM` it refuses
what it should refuse and answers nothing else, and some contract tests in
`tests/test_contract.py` are marked as expected failures on purpose. Making them
pass is the work. What to add, session by session, is in `docs/` (each file
names the session that fills it).

The provider comes from `.env` (`BOOTCAMP_PROVIDER`), and falls back to the
offline `FakeLLM`. Keys live only in `.env`, which git ignores.
